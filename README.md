# SpaceChip8
A Javascript emulator for the famous Chip-8 processor.
This is a learning project following the tutorial from [Alexander Dickson](https://github.com/alexanderdickson) and his repository [Chip-8-Emulator](https://github.com/alexanderdickson/Chip-8-Emulator).

## Running
You may use whatever server system to run the emulator on your browser. I used [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server#readme).

## Implementation
Since this is a simple emulator and doesn't need full optimization, I used a big switch loop to handle every cpu opcode.
Next, I tried a NES emulator that you can check [here](https://github.com/caioaletroca/HappiNESs).
